# AUTOSAR DRIVERS FOR TIVA C

This repository contains my implementation of part of the Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL) for the Tiva C microcontroller according to the AUTOSAR R21-22 standard. This is an in progress project aimed at learning the AUTOSAR standard and implementing it on a real microcontroller.

Current Drivers:

- Port
